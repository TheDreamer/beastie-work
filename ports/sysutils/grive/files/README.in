This README adapted from http://www.lbreda.com/grive/installation

6. Copying the Executable
=========================
You probably won't want to run grive in the directory it is installed in.
That entire directory would be uploaded to your google drive, and your google
drive would be downloaded into the directory.

So copy the grive executable to the top level of your local google drive
directory.

cp %%DATADIR%%/grive /home/you/yourGoogleDrive/

 * As a side effect, this file will be uploaded ("sync'd") by grive to
   your Google Drive top-level directory.

   [So, if you also use the Linux version the name should be changed.]

 * There is one terrific advantage -- you can copy the grive executable to
   different directories, sync'd with different Google Drive accounts, and it
   should all work.

7. Backup
=========
Since, grive is alpha softwre, you DEFINITELY want to keep a backup copy of
your google directory.

You can download an archive of your data at Google using
https://www.google.com/takeout

8. First Run
============
Change to your google drive directory and run grive.

cd /home/you/yourGoogleDrive
./grive -a

  * The "-a" option is only needed the very first time you run grive.
  * Visit the URL that comes up, then post the auth code given (you must have
    been logged into Google).  You should get some messages including
    "Synchronizing files"... now you are running.

9. Syncs
========
To sync, you must run the program manually (there is no "real-time watching"
yet).  At the prompt, type:

./grive

You can set up a cron job, if you want this done on a regular basis.

If you get a "crash" (bunch of error meesages on the screen), you should
run:

./grive -l log.txt

to create a file you can send to

Nestal - https://plus.google.com/117286709411978324355

As the file will contain a log of the syn operation, you may want to edit the
file firs tto remove personally sensitive information.
