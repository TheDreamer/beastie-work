PATCHES

databases/pecl-mysqlnd_qc

	Keep seeing the advise to use memcache instead of query cache in mysql, but it stumped me on how would I do this
	without requiring that I change the applications (the big one being cacti.)

	When I finally came across this extension, which sounded like it would fit.
	Except it didn't, because I use spine. :(

	Anyways, while trying it out, I couldn't figure out how to get it to use memcached.  Well, these are enabled at
	compile time, and the port didn't ask if I wanted to enable MEMCACHE or sqlite storage handlers.  So fiddled with
	the Makefile to have it ask.

	Wonder if I'll submit it?

	Decided to first remove reference to APC.

databases/pecl-mysqlnd_qc/patch-php_mysqlnd_qc.c

	Going with mysqlnd_qc.cache_by_default, there needed to be a way (to me) to have it use MEMCACHE by default.
	I started trying to add a new INI option to do this, but doing development on a 'production' server is bad,
	so I went with the QAD way....

mail/dovecot2

	ports/175813: [patch] mail/dovecot2 doesn't detect libstemmer or exttextcat

	Patches to get dovecot2 with fts_lucene to work, because textproc/libexttextcat has incremented its library name so
	configure, has trouble finding it.

	libstemmer is incorporated into lib-clucene-contribs-lib.so in textproc/clucene

	libextextcat has gone from:
	    libexttextcat.so(.*) ->
		libexttextcat-1.0.so(.*)->
			libexttextcat-2.0.so(.*)

mail/davmail

	Update to 4.4.0

net/nxserver

	PORTREVISION got bumped to 9, due to newer libaudiofile.  But, it wouldn't build.  audiofile-config has been
	removed, for pkgconf but nxserver (specifically nxesd's) configure doesn't know how to deal with this.  Started
	trying to patch configure, when I went with setting AUDIOFILE_CONFIG="/usr/local/bin/pkgconf audiofile" and
	passing _--disable-audiofiletest_ to configure.  It can still get the necessary lib flags and cflags using the first
	part, but the process of checking that 0.3.6 is greater than minimum version of 0.1.5 was easier solved by disabling
	the test.

	Could have port system check version, but can't do that on a LIB_DEPENDS and went for simple.

sysutils/cfengine35

	Kind of odd making a patch for FreeBSD when the problem is upstream.
	
	So, opted to report it upstream, but in the meantime I rebuild cfengine using this patch.

	-------------------------------------------

	Issue #3207 - configure fails to find libxml2

	configure doesn't find -lxml2, because it doesn't call
		"xml2-config --libs" to get the LDFLAGS needed to find it.

	-------------------------------------------

	But, then also reported for FreeBSD.

	PR: ports/180896

	sysutils/cfengine35: can't use edit_xml because libxml2 not found

	========================================================================

	patch-3.5.1-3

	Noticed that the new CFEngine Standard Library for 3.5.1 is missing, so that's what 3.5.1-3 is.

	PR: ports/181509

sysutils/panicmail

	Recently, I had yet another panic.  Couldn't remember how I had examined the previous vmcore, while searching online
	on how again I came across this port.

	Almost immediately, I made some tweaks to it.  Like change the From: address for autosubmit to use a proper email
	address rather than my internal root account.

	I forget if I ever got around to creating a genericstable config for my FreeBSD sendmail servers, which have
	replaced my Ubuntu postfix servers.  Though if I had, the address I would use in place of root on my primary desktop
	would differ from the email address I use for FreeBSD related correspondence.
	
	Initially, I made the tweaks by hand and then coded up a CFE3 promise to recreate it on my other FreeBSD servers.

	Then, I started to set things up for possible PR submission to send up my 'enhancements'.  But, as I was doing that,
	I thought up other enhancements and it got a little out of hand.  Now, I'm not sure I want to send it up....

	new rc.conf(.local) entries (with defaults):

		panicmail_autonotify="YES"
		panicmail_sendfrom="root"
		panicmail_usecrashinfo="NO"
		panicmail_usekernel=""

pr178818

	docs/178818 
		gmirror(8) says to use rc.eary which is no longer available

	proposed fix is to automate this in the dumpon script, which had one small flaw, which I corrected.  And, then tried
	to recall how to include a patch that won't get munged by mail client....
